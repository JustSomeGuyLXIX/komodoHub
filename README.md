My code from a uni group project where we were tasked with making a website for the public with features specifically for students and teachers.
React was used to make the website itself with the database being made in SQLite, in addition to python being used as well, as can be seen with the login system i made.

There are plans to recreate the website from scratch by myself while also implementing the features we didn't have to to finish, so i can learn about the whole process of making a website.
